First Steps with Git and cloning repositories
===============================================================

These are some brief notes on getting our repositories up and working on a new computer. 
It assumes you have some familiarity with git. If not, go and read the [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/) lessons on git. 
You can also have a look at our [in-house git lessons](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/NMDM_Course/html/index.html). 

These notes are intended for developers of our code. If you are not a developer of our code, this will probably not be very interesting and I suggest you find [something else to do](http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/news/tickets).

* First, [clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) one of the repositories. 
* For example, if you want to clone this directory, you navigate to the folder where you want to put the code and type:
'''$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDGitNotes.git```
* In github, the address of the repo is usually on the right column of the webiste toward the bottom. 
* The 'origin' of these files should be set after the cloning process, but if not you can reset them by [following these directions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes).
